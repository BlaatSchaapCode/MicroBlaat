# Cypress PSoC4 series

The Cypress PSoC 4 series are a series of Cortex-M0 and Cortex-M0+ microcontrollers. Within the PSoC4 series there are some sub-series and families.

For each series Cypress releases an Architecture and Registers TRM (Technical Reference Manual). However, the information in these documents are scattered and sometimes incomplete. For example, the Registers TRM has multiple revisions, where some registers were added and some were removed, and some registers mentioned in the Architecture TRM are missing from the Registers TRM. Since the series are simular, some information can be gathered from a TRM from a different series.

In this document I will try put the information together in an accesible and searchable way.

The families are (mentioned in the "PSoC 4 Interrupts" (AN90799) document

* PSoC 4000 
* PSoC 4100/4200 
* PSoC 4 BLE
* PSoC 4 M
* PSoC 4 L
* PSoC 4000S
* PSoC 4100S
* PSoC 4100S Plus
* PSoC 4100PS

There are some some families not mentioned in this document

* PSoC 4 Analog Coprocessor 
* PSoC 4200D 
* PSoC 4200DS 
* PSoC 4700 

In this document I will mainly focus on the PSoC 4100/4200 family and the 4 M family, as this is the hardware I own, namely a CY8CKIT-049 and a CY8CKIT-043.
